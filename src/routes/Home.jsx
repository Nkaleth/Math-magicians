    <h2>What is Mathematics?</h2>
    <p>
      Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers,
      formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are
      contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented
      in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,algebra
      geometry, and analysis, respectively. There is no general consensus among
      mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline.
